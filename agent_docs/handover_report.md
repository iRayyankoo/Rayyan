## Instructions for the New Device

### 1. Synchronize the Code
Ensure all local changes are pushed to your Git repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Handover: Code and Task UI state"
git push
```
On the new device:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
npm install
```

### 2. Synchronize the "AI Brain" (Context)
To help me (the AI) pick up exactly where we left off with the same task list and progress:

- **Option A (Manual Copy)**: Copy the "Brain" folder from your current PC:
  Path: `C:\Users\L\.gemini\antigravity\brain\4a9a2727-37fc-4f04-bf44-1cd3143fcbdd`
  Paste it into the same location on your new PC.
  
- **Option B (Reference File)**: If you start a fresh session, simply share this file (`agent_docs/handover_report.md`) with me and tell me "Resume from this handover report."

### 3. Verification
Once set up on the new device:
1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Check `agent_docs/task.md` to see the roadmap.
3. Call me to start the next subtask for **Cloud Favorites**.
